### Step 5: Zenmap

Your client has asked that you help identify any vulnerabilities with their file-sharing server. Using the Metasploitable machine to act as your client's server, complete the following:

- Command for Zenmap to run a service scan against the Metasploitable machine: 
 - `nmap -sV 192.168.0.10`

- Bonus command to output results into a new text file named `zenmapscan.txt`:
 - `-oN zenmapscan.txt`

- Zenmap vulnerability script command: 
 - `nmap --script ftp-vsftpd-backdoor,smb-enum-shares 192.168.0.10`

- Once you have identified this vulnerability, answer the following questions for your client:
  1. What is the vulnerability: 
   - There are multiple files in the tmp directory that allow anonymous read/write access.

  2. Why is it dangerous: 
   - It is dangerour because this allows users without specfic priveleges to gain read/write capabilities to files.

  3. What mitigation strategies can you recommendations for the client to protect their server:
